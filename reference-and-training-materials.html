    <h1>Reference and Training Materials</h1>
    <h2>Project Summary</h2>
    <p>This documentation was created as a term project for COMM 2206: Writing for the Computer Industry, taken as part of the Technical Writing Certificate at the British Columbia Institute of Technology.</p>
    <p>The goal of the project was to create documentation that would teach indie tabletop roleplaying game (TTRPG) designers how to create digital play aids in Google Sheets. Specifically, I set out to create a video and accompanying content that guides the user through the creation of a character keeper with basic and intermediate automation. The tutorial covers a wide range of basic tools and thoroughly explains their functions so that they can easily be applied to other purposes.
    
    <h3><a href="/portfolio/reference-and-training-materials/final-documentation.html">Final Documentation</a></h3>
    <p>The final documentation is a 40 minute long video tutorial for creating an automated character keeper in Google Sheets. Each step, function, and formula is thoroughly explained so that the user fully understands what they're doing and why, forming highly adaptable building blocks of knowledge and skill.</p>
    <p>Accompanying the video is a 1 page PDF of the rules for a game designed for use in the tutorial so that users can complete the project alongside the tutorial, a completed version of the project for users to examine and compare, and a 20 page reference document. The reference document contains a written version of the instructions, which are condensed but organised in the same sections as the video for ease of use. The instructions have formulas that can be copy-pasted so that the user doesn't have to type everything from the screen and audio. It also contains its own breakdowns of the functions and formulas used in the tutorial.</p>
    <h3><a href="/portfolio/reference-and-training-materials/user-analysis.html">Report: User Analysis</a></h3>
    <p>In the process of creating the documentation, I wrote this 2500 word report on primary qualitative user research, demonstrating my ability to cater content to specific audiences. I conducted a series of one-on-one interviews with members of the targeted community to get a sense of their needs, then synthesised the results into three unique user profiles and a documentation rationale.</p>
