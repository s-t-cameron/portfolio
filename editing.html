    <h1>Editing</h1>
    <p>The majority of my editing work has been in the field of tabletop roleplaying games. Not only do TTRPG books have to read as cleanly as any other written publication, they also have to convey complex rules to readers at a variety of skill levels. I specialise in helping to craft clear, logically laid-out instructions that don't grate against themselves or the flow of their intended use.</p>
    <p>As a developmental and substantive editor (or sometimes "design consultant", a type of developmental editing pertaining to game mechanics), I enjoy working closely with writers, making sure I have a thorough understanding of their intentions and helping them make sure those intentions are conveyed. I work flexibly at the micro and the macro level, able both to dig in deep and to look at the bigger picture, ensuring that every aspect of the work is clear.</p>

        <p class="portfolio"><b>Pearse Anderson, creator of <a href="https://pearseanderson.itch.io/likeness"><em>Likeness Machines</em></a>:</b> I needed to release the project on a tight timeline — who knew when the strike would end — and the one editor who jumped in to help on that timeline was Satah. I finished the rules for this TTRPG (Likeness Machines) and passed them to Satah without ever playtesting the game, naming it, or feeling 100% about it. That didn't stop Satah, who turned around edits under schedule with tons of suggestions. Dense, marked-up Google Doc. Love it. Working with Satah, we were able to blend Old Hollywood anachronisms with dystopic AI satires and still keep it all on one page. I was still learning the terms of my own mechanics (Crises, Stress, Reversed Major Arcana, etc.) and they helped flatten that while keeping the tone. Thanks to their quick work and many late nights designing and re-designing Likeness Machines' layout, I was able to release the game 3 days after their edits, after only 2 playtests! It's been passed out on Hollywood lots, Chicago strikelines, and over Twitch streams.</p>
        <p class="portfolio"><b>Jess Levine, creator of <em><a href="https://jumpgategames.itch.io/ihthg">I Have the High Ground</a></em>, <em><a href="https://jumpgategames.itch.io/going-rogue">going rogue 2e</a></em>, and <em><a href="https://jumpgategames.itch.io/planetfist">PLANET FIST</a></em>, when reviewers noted her impeccable inclusion of tips & advice to players:</b> I want to note that having Satah as a design consultant on both helps drives this—Satah is GREAT at identifying player pain points & challenging me to write notes that help players navigate the game-as-played. I am very proud to have widely applicable tips, examples, and designer's notes labeled as my “calling card” because I believe they're vital to player experience & I'm proud of how I write them, but it's been so crucial how Satah's critical eye has repeatedly prompted me to do so.</p>
