    <h1>TTRPG Writing, Design, Editing, and Consultation</h1>
    <p>As a game designer and writer, I specialise in genre fiction, character creation, and creating depth in condensed formats. I'm particularly adept at crafting tables that hit the very delicate balance of specific and open that makes them the most inspiring and useful as a tool.</p>
    <p>Editing and consultation are the perfect opportunity to further channel my obsession with TTRPG mechanics and game philosophy into productive conversations. I enjoy working closely with designers to narrow in on what they're trying to do and say with the rules of their game, developing a thorough understanding of their intentions and helping them make sure those intentions are conveyed. I work flexibly at the micro and the macro level, able both to dig in deep and to look at the bigger picture, ensuring that every aspect of the work is clear.</p>

            <h3>Testimonials</h3>
            <p class="portfolio"><b>Jess Levine of <a href="https://jumpgategames.itch.io/">Jumpgate Games</a>:</b> Satah has design consulted on I Have the High Ground, going rogue 2e, and PLANET FIST. If you liked any them: they wouldn't have been ANYWHERE near as good without Satah's work. Did you think the IHtHG "Descriptor" mechanic for making PCs foils of each other was clever? Satah. Did you like the idea of THE BOND pillar in going rogue 2e, representing a relationship as a setting element? Satah. Do you find PLANET FIST item rules elegantly concise? Satah.</p>
            <p class="portfolio"><b>Pearse Anderson, creator of <a class="title" href="https://pearseanderson.itch.io/likeness">Likeness Machines</a>:</b> I needed to release the project on a tight timeline — who knew when the strike would end — and the one editor who jumped in to help on that timeline was Satah. I finished the rules for this TTRPG (Likeness Machines) and passed them to Satah without ever playtesting the game, naming it, or feeling 100% about it. That didn't stop Satah, who turned around edits under schedule with tons of suggestions. Dense, marked-up Google Doc. Love it. Working with Satah, we were able to blend Old Hollywood anachronisms with dystopic AI satires and still keep it all on one page. I was still learning the terms of my own mechanics (Crises, Stress, Reversed Major Arcana, etc.) and they helped flatten that while keeping the tone. Thanks to their quick work and many late nights designing and re-designing Likeness Machines' layout, I was able to release the game 3 days after their edits, after only 2 playtests! It's been passed out on Hollywood lots, Chicago strikelines, and over Twitch streams.</p>
            <p class="portfolio"><b>Jess Levine, when reviewers of <a class="title" href="https://jumpgategames.itch.io/ihthg">I Have the High Ground</a> and <a class="title" href="https://jumpgategames.itch.io/going-rogue">going rogue 2e</a> noted her impeccable inclusion of tips & advice to players:</b> I want to note that having Satah as a design consultant on both helps drives this—Satah is GREAT at identifying player pain points & challenging me to write notes that help players navigate the game-as-played. I am very proud to have widely applicable tips, examples, and designer's notes labeled as my “calling card” because I believe they're vital to player experience & I'm proud of how I write them, but it's been so crucial how Satah's critical eye has repeatedly prompted me to do so.</p>
